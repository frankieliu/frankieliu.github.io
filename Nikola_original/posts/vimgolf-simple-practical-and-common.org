*temp var1 0
*temp var2 "hi"
*temp var3 -1
*temp var4 42
*temp var5 "asdf"
*temp var6 0

Simple things we do all the time should be able to be done with very few keystrokes, but sometimes I find something I need to do makes me go, "There MUST be a better way."

This challenge is just a simple movement and entering text at a certain place.

New text.

This challenge is just a simple movement and entering text at a certain place.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Solution
6GYp<C-A>w11<C-A>GONew t<C-N><C-N>.<CR><Esc>ZZ

* Moving down
- 5j :: moving down to line var6
- 6G :: Go to line 6

* Copying and pasting
- Yp :: yank line and put

* Increase count
- CTRL-A :: increase 6 to 7
- w :: move to next word
- [count]CTRL-A :: increase by count [count], in this case count = 11

* Move to end
- GO :: Go to end and Open a line above

* Start typing
- New t<C-N><C-N>.<CR> :: this has the interesting effect of
     searching forward for the words beginning with t.
