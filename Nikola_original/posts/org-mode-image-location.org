I did not like the limited options offered by the orgmode plugin that
came with nikola.  It suggests using =img-url:= link which does not
allow me to add =ATTR_HTML= or a =CAPTION= that comes nicely with
=org-export=.

Let's add an image here: 

#+CAPTION: Image from cannon.js
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt cat/spider image :title Action! :align center :width 200
[[../../images/org-mode/cannon_js.png]]

This was added as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+CAPTION: Image from cannon.js
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt cat/spider image :title Action! :align center :width 200
[[../../images/org-mode/cannon_js.png]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now, we also create a symbolic link to =files/images= in order to
point the final location of the =images/= directory that should be
added to =files/= directory.  The =images/= final output location will
be at =/= which is located two back references from the =posts=
directory.

Adding a symbolic link in the =source= branch allows one to visit the
link in org-mode, while at the same time point to the correct output
directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd $nikola_root
mkdir -p files/images/org-mode
# move cannon_js.png into this directory
ln -s $(pwd)/files/images ../images
#+END_SRC
