# -*- mode: org -*-
#+STARTUP: indent hidestars showall

* installing nikola
#+begin_src bash
  conda activate
  pip install Nikola[extras]
  nikola version
#+end_src

* get a site up and running
#+begin_src bash
  nikola init mysite
  cd mysite
  nikola new_post
  nikola build
  nikola serve -b
  # nikola auto --browser
#+end_src

* adding org support
#+begin_src bash
  nikola new_post -F
  nikola plugin -i orgmode
  emacs conf.py
  echo <<EOF
  # add the following lines

  Contents of the conf.py.sample file:

  # NOTE: Needs additional configuration in init.el file.

  # Add the orgmode compiler to your COMPILERS dict.
  COMPILERS["orgmode"] = ('.org',)

  # Add org files to your POSTS, PAGES
  POSTS = POSTS + (("posts/*.org", "posts", "post.tmpl"),)
  PAGES = PAGES + (("pages/*.org", "pages", "page.tmpl"),)
  EOF
  nikola new_post -f orgmode
  nikola build
  nikola serve -b
#+end_src

* adding math support
add a field in the preamble, =has_math: true=

* adding code
it shoud work out of the box

* deploying on github.io
# I chose to name the source branch "source" (it is "src" by default)
# For this you need to change the lines
# GITHUB_SOURCE_BRANCH = 'source'

By default nikola works off from the src branch and output goes to the master
branch.

Also you need to add the following under files/CNAME:
www.frankliu.org

Since this is the name from the domain provider and the one that github.io
was configured with, under settings for this repository, you can set the custom
domain field to 'www.frankliu.org'

Finally from nikola in the 'source' branch you can:
nikola github_deploy

This will create a new branch 'master' where the generated pages will reside.
